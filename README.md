Hi my name is René Kaufmann, I am 41 years life experienced and was born in germany Berlin.

In high school I started coding with Turbo Pascal and enjoyed programming with it. But I learned a profession in electrical engineering 🔌 and tried out a lot of different works 🪛 🔧 ,  now I work as an order manager in an office with SAP, Outlook and EXCEL! So later I started programming with Visual Basic and VBA via self study. I really like to write code for office automation in VBA. The last project is for SAP scripting with VBA.

I like gardening🥬🍎, cycling🚴 and reading books 📚, deep intense conversations🤓 and personality development - It is my childhood dream to become a programmer.
